## Installation & Local Setup

To work with this project locally:

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanhollingsworth123/content-generator-frontend-practice-project.git
Open index.html in your browser

You can simply double-click the file, or

Serve it locally with a simple server:

npx http-server .
Interact with the app

Click buttons to generate content

**How It Works**

The HTML page contains UI elements like buttons and content containers.

index.js listens for button clicks.

When triggered, the script selects or generates new content and updates the page dynamically.

Styles from style.css ensure the UI looks presentable and responsive.

This approach reinforces key frontend skills like event handling and dynamic rendering.
